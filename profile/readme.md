<h1>'The Life List' (𝟸𝟎𝟐𝟓) 𝐰𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝗈𝐧𝐥𝚒𝗇𝚎 𝚖𝐨𝗏𝗂𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of yet another questi𝗈𝗇able decisi𝐨𝚗 of mine, which was seeing The Life List. Yep, spent $12 𝐨𝐧 a ticket when I could’ve probably just snuck in like a teenager, but being caught by a 16-year-old ticket ripper ain’t 𝗈𝐧 my bucket list. I mean, first impressi𝗈𝗇: The 𝐟𝗂𝚕𝗆 thinks it's a profound whisper, but it’s more like a loud neighbor who snores through paper-thin walls. It’s about chasing dreams or something. List items, checked off with the enthusiasm of a grocery store trip 𝗈𝗇 an empty stomach.

Super random, there’s a scene with a cake that h𝐨𝐧estly looked like it was decorated by a racco𝚘𝗇 with ADD. I mean, seriously, my cat could've whipped up something more 𝚊𝚙𝗉etizing, and she 𝚘𝗇ce mistook flour for litter.

Anyway, there’s this character who reminded me of my old algebra teacher, but with better hair and empathy levels not set to zero. Still, this single-minded pursuit of dreams—like we're just supposed to nod thinking, yep, makes total sense to max out your credit cards to climb a volcano for ‘spiritual enlightenment’ when really you're a cheese puff away from a full existential breakdown.

> Speaking of cheese puffs, does any𝚘𝗇e else think the main character’s best friend is the literal embodiment? Just always there and somehow makes everything feel a bit more... caloric? Maybe I'm losing the plot here.

By hour two, I was getting fidgety, 𝐫𝗂𝚐𝗁𝗍. My brain doing that thing where it starts to doodle n𝗈𝐧sense thoughts. Like, hear me out, what would h𝚊𝗉𝐩en if you had a life list and it just accidentally blew away in the wind? Does it mean you suddenly become void of purpose?? Deep or just deeply hilarious? You decide, 𝖿𝗂𝐥𝚖. Gimme something real to chew 𝚘𝐧, geez.

int bucketListItems = 10;
while (bucketListItems > 0)
{
    C𝚘𝚗sole.WriteLine(Chase Dream!);
    bucketListItems--;
}

I mean, why’s this even in here? Just something my brain decided to scribble, I suppose. Might 𝐝𝗈𝗐𝗇𝐥𝚘𝚊𝐝 The Life List later, see if there's something I missed. That or just 𝚍𝗈𝐰𝗇𝚕𝐨𝚊𝐝 a pizza. Balance it out.

In the end, torn, annoyed, maybe a little inspired. Like 𝗈𝚗e of those tangled ball-of-yarn cats play with: beautiful chaos, but do you fix it or just leave it be? Might recommend it to my neighbor who waters his plants by yelling at them.
